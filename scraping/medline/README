http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corehtml/query/static/eutils_help.html

We just went ahead and do a search on Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) limited to English language articles.
We set the view to MEDLINE, number of results to 200 and ordered by date. We get about 15M documents.
We use urlparms to transform POST to GET, then we do a first post to get the session cookie then mass download all urls
from page 1 till the last page. We're done.
